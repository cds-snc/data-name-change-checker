# Government of Canada Department and Agency Name Change Checker

There are more than 100 departments and agencies within the Government of Canada,
and the titles they use are not always standardized. Frequency, their legal title
(e.g., "Department of Industry") is different than the title they use in practice
(e.g., "Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada"). Changes to the applied
titles is frequent, especially when there are changes in government.

This repository hosts a Github Action that checks the Open Government Dataset
titled [Official titles of Government of Canada departments and agencies](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/83320390-7715-43bc-a281-2049bf5d4232/resource/f0ca63e0-c15e-45b5-9656-77abe1564b1c). 
If there have been changes to the dataset since the last time we checked, it 
sends an alert to the CDS Relationship Management Slack channel, so they can 
take the appropriate action. This saves them the trouble of manually comparing
the list weekly.
